This is my personal blog — not related to or affiliated with any company activity. I
write, irregularly, about various technical topics that interest me, often as a personal
challenge to learn new things.

A common theme is my fascination with complexity optimization in constrained
system environments, starting with software, then digital design, analog circuits, and
more recently machine learning ("AI").

The blog started with explorations of addressable RGB LEDs. During covid
lockdowns I went on a tangent to design digital circuits from discrete
components using low-cost PCB assembly services. A pet project of mine is finding
an elegant and physically grounded algorithm for realistic electronic candle
flicker, which, I swear, one day I will solve...
