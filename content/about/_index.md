This is my personal blog — not related to or affiliated with any company activity. I
write, irregularly, about various technical topics that interest me, often as a personal
challenge to learn new things.

A common theme is my fascination with complexity optimization in constrained
system environments, starting with software, then digital design, analog circuits, and
more recently machine learning/AI.
